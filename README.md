# upload
a really simple upload/download tool for windows-cmd and a really simple upload tool for linux-bash

In the Windows folder there is also a download.bat file because in contrast to linux, as far as I know, no download tool is preinstalled

## Linux setup:
```
sudo wget https://github.com/kordexjan/upload-tool-Linux/archive/master.zip -P /bin/
```
```
cd /bin/
```
```
sudo unzip
```
